# GDD: Ageis
## Introduction
Ageis is a game about goal driven colony builder. My insperation comes from the obvious Dwarf Fortress, but also Majesty. Majesty gives the player limited control over pawns, but gives them free access to build and place incentives on the objectives of the map as well as other threats that might find them selves wrecking havok upon you.

Some key differences from Dwarf Fortress will be a smaller simulation. The simulation will be localized to a much smaller region over a couple different territories. These territories will be the bases of you game. Being more centralized on these territories we can tell stories based on a the goal for the map as well as created goals (this might be revised to be goals created from the map soley).
